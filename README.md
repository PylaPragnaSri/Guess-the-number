Number Guessing Game buillt with the help of C++

Concepts involved
- loops
- conditionals and random number generation.




How the code actually works

- The computer randomly selects a number between 1 and 100.
- The user tries to guess the number.
- After each guess, you will a  get feedback:
  - Too high!Try again.
  - Too low!Try again
  - Correct! You guessed it in....attempt(s).
- It tracks how many attempts you take and lets you replay the game.
  - Do you want to play again? (y/n):
  - here y||Y for yes.



How the code actually runs:

- A C++ compiler (like `g++`)

To compile and to run
g++ number_guessing_game.cpp -o game
./game
